# TakeMeHome

## Background
A local transport service provider app for android in the area of Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology,Bangladesh.
The university is located almost 20 km outside of the main town of Chittagong,Bangladesh.The only transportations available are local taxis ( with 5 passengers per taxi ) and local tempoos ( with 12 passengers per tempoo).
But the stoppage of both the tempoos and taxis are at around 10/15 minuites walking distance from the main gate of the university.

The idea of the application is based on this problem stated above.The passengers can request for a vehicle from the university campus.Whenever maxmimum number of requests are confirmed that fits in a vehicle, the online driver will get a notification in his mobile.Then, he can go to the main gate of the campus to receive the passengers.

### Feature updates :
1. The request of the passenger / online status of the driver will be automatically turned off if the user is not in the 2 km radius of the university campus.
2. The user can cancel a request if he no longer needs a ride.

### Languages used :
#### Front-end : Java (Android)
#### Server-side : GoLang
